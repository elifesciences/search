Martin Stratmann, President of the Max Planck Society (which funds eLife), also spoke of the need for open-access journals to challenge \"highly valued journals like Science, Nature and Cell\"."

The key messages were drawn together into a call for action across establishments, with two main goals arising: firstly, for all publicly funded scientific publications in the EU to be open access by 2020 and, secondly, for open-data principles to be followed as standard for all publicly funded research. These goals were adopted by EU ministers for Research and Innovation on 27 May."
