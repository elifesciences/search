        "text": "The mis-folding and aggregation of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) such as α-synuclein (αS) underlie the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders. However, targeting αS with small molecules faces challenges due to the lack of defined ligand-binding pockets in its disordered structure. Here, we implement a deep artificial neural network-based machine learning approach, which is able to statistically distinguish the fuzzy ensemble of conformational substates of αS in neat water from those in aqueous fasudil (small molecule of interest) solution. In particular, the presence of fasudil in the solvent either modulates pre-existing states of αS or gives rise to new conformational states of αS, akin to an ensemble-expansion mechanism. The ensembles display strong conformation-dependence in residue-wise interaction with the small molecule. A thermodynamic analysis indicates that small-molecule modulates the structural repertoire of αS by tuning protein backbone entropy, however entropy of the water remains unperturbed. Together, this study sheds light on the intricate interplay between small molecules and IDPs, offering insights into entropic modulation and ensemble expansion as key biophysical mechanisms driving potential therapeutics.",

In rational structure-based drug design, exploration of the target proteins is a crucial step based on which the interactions of small molecules are optimized to have stabilising interactions with a structured ligand-binding pocket (<a href=\"#bib19\">Bronowska, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Klebe, 2015</a>) and is typically applied to folded proteins. IDPs, however, are considered <i>undruggable</i> since they exist as an ensemble of conformations that precludes the usage of these traditional drug-design strategies (<a href=\"#bib71\">Metallo, 2010</a>). Nevertheless, a few monomeric disordered proteins such as the oncogenic transcription factor c-Myc (<a href=\"#bib40\">Follis et al., 2008</a>), Abeta42 (<a href=\"#bib76\">Ono et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Zhu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Attanasio et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ehrnhoefer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Heller et al., 2020</a>),Tau (<a href=\"#bib4\">Akoury et al., 2013</a>), PTP1B (<a href=\"#bib61\">Krishnan et al., 2014</a>), and osteopontin <a href=\"#bib63\">Kurzbach et al., 2014</a> have been successfully targeted by small molecules (<a href=\"#bib14\">Biesaga et al., 2021</a>). The IDP of this article’s interest, alpha-synuclein (αS) has remained an important drug-target (<a href=\"#bib36\">Fields et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Tóth et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Tatenhorst et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Cao et al., 2022</a>) owing to its long-rooted association with neurodegenerative diseases. Often, the early aggregation stages of αS into small oligomers is implicated in the causation of Parkinson’s disease (<a href=\"#bib103\">Winner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Emin et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Stephens et al., 2023</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Ubbiali et al., 2022</a>) and a potential therapeutic strategy has been the stabilization of αS in soluble monomeric form. In particular, the small molecule fasudil (focus of the present investigation) has been shown to interact with αS and retard its aggregation (<a href=\"#bib93\">Tatenhorst et al., 2016</a>). The anti-aggregative effect of fasudil on αS assembly was tested both in vivo and in vitro and it was found to significantly reduce αS aggregation in both scenarios. Characterisation of the effect of small molecule binding on the ensemble properties of IDPs and the molecular details of the stabilizing interactions can provide the basis for selectivity and can be effectively calibrated to induce the desired effect to alleviate disease conditions. In particular, latest effort by Robustelli and coworkers (<a href=\"#bib83\">Robustelli et al., 2022</a>) had produced an unprecedentedly long-time scale (1500 µs) all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectory of a small molecule drug, fasudil with monomeric αS, in which the predicted protein-fasudil interactions were found to be in good agreement with previously reported NMR chemical shift data. However, comparison of the global and local structural features of the αS ensemble in neat water and that in the presence of fasudil (<a href=\"#bib83\">Robustelli et al., 2022</a>; see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</a>–<a href=\"#fig1s6\">6</a>) did not indicate a significant difference that is a customary signature of the dynamic IDP ensemble. Characterization of the peculiar nature of IDPs such as αS using the conventional experimental and computational approaches have proven to be challenging. IDPs can be best described by an ensemble of conformations potentially sampled by the protein along with their associated statistical/thermodynamic weights. While biophysical methods can provide an ensemble averaged conformation of an IDP, computer simulations can extensively sample the conformational ensembles of IDPs at atomic resolutions. However, biophysical methods lack the potential to provide an ensemble view and there are inherent limitations of force fields used in computer simulations to model IDPs in agreement with experiments. Integrative approaches have been exploited in studying IDPs as well as small-molecule binding to IDPs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bonomi et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Bottaro and Lindorff-Larsen, 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Robustelli et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Gomes et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Stelzl et al., 2022</a>). In recent years, Markov State Models (MSMs) have been exploited to elucidate a states-and-rates view of biomolecular dynamics i.e. finding the kinetically relevant states and the transition rates between them (<a href=\"#bib79\">Prinz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Bowman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Husic and Pande, 2018</a>). The first step in the process of building a kinetic model / MSM of any complex biomolecular ensemble is to identify a suitable metric or collective variable (CV) that efficiently captures its conformational space.",

        {
          "text": "CVs such as torsion angles, distances, chemical shifts and so forth, can characterize the complex molecular motion in a high number of dimensions. However, this presents a challenge to effectively analyze trajectories generated from MD simulations. In order to address this, dimension reduction is performed to obtain a set of slow variables that can be further subjected to clustering into kinetically discrete metastable states. Since the high-dimensional input features describing the heterogeneous conformational landscape of IDPs can have non-linear relationships, non-linear dimension reduction techniques are most suitable. Recent advances in the field of machine learning have shown better results in capturing such non-linear relationships (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adhikari and Mondal, 2023</a>). In this study, we employed a deep neural network, specifically β-variational autoencoder (<a href=\"#bib57\">Kingma and Welling, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Rezende et al., 2014</a>) to perform dimension reduction and further utilized this machine-learnt latent dimension for building MSM in order to better understand the conformational landscape of IDPs in presence and in absence of a small molecule. In the current work, to elucidate the small-molecule mediated modulatory effect on αS ensemble, we harnessed deep-learning based β-Variational AutoEncoder (β-VAE) and Markov State Models (MSM) to dissect αS ensemble in water and in aqueous fasudil solution. A projection of the atomistically simulated conformation ensemble of αS in its apo state and in presence of Fasudil, along their respective latent space describes the conformational landscape, which is further refined by developing individual MSMs. Our result reveals that, compared to the macrostates identified in water, the presence of fasudil led to an increase in the number of metastable states. Characterisation of small-molecule interaction with the protein indicates that fasudil has differential interactions with each of these macrostates. These macrostates exhibit clear distinctions as evident from their C<sub>α</sub> contact maps which was further analysed using a convolutional VAE. An entropic perspective at the global (whole protein) and local (residue) level reveals that fasudil binding can potentially trap the protein and the resultant states may be disordered or ordered in nature. The effect is mainly manifested at the backbone level with a decrease in entropy at the fasudil binding hotspots in some states. The observations reported in this study demonstrate how the binding of a small molecule, fasudil, modulates the conformational properties of the disordered protein, αS, manifested as a change in the backbone entropy of the fasudil binding hotspots.",

This prompted us to analyse the two ensembles using the framework of MSM. As a suitable input feature to build the MSM, we estimated the set of inter-residue Cα pairwise distances, as this feature largely incorporates the conformational space of αS. In a standard MSM analysis, this high-dimensional input feature requires further processing such as dimensionality reduction, before discretisation using clustering for the construction of an MSM.",

Dimension reduction using principal component analysis, independent component analysis (<a href=\"#bib53\">Hyvärinen, 2013</a>), singular value decomposition (<a href=\"#bib60\">Klema and Laub, 1980</a>) and linear discriminant analysis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Fisher, 1936</a>) linearly transform the high dimensional data into a lower dimensional manifold.

This high dimensional input is represented into a lower dimensional latent space, which is then used to reconstruct the input. However, the latent space is ‘<math id=\"inf1\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mtext>deterministic</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>’, that is it provides only a fixed mapping of the input to latent space, which might not account for variations or uncertainty present in the data. Consequently, this could generate an inaccurate result for a point that does not exist in the latent space. Thus, when projecting new, similar data onto the latent space, a deterministic autoencoder will map similar inputs to nearly identical points in the latent space, potentially lacking the diversity and capturing only a single mode of the data distribution. In contrast, the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is ‘<math id=\"inf2\"><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\" scriptlevel=\"0\"><mrow><mtext>probabilistic</mtext></mrow></mstyle></math>’ in nature, thereby avoiding this limitation of autoencoders.

A VAE consists of an encoder network and a decoder network, much like a traditional autoencoder. The encoder takes input data and maps it to a probabilistic distribution in the latent space, while the decoder reconstructs the input data from samples drawn from this distribution. The probabilistic nature of the latent space is a result of applying variational inference, which aims to estimate the actual posterior using an approximate distribution, parameterized by a mean vector and a variance vector. This estimation is achieved by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (also known as relative entropy or information gain) between the two distributions. As a result, instead of producing a single point in the latent space for each input, the encoder outputs a distribution. The latent variable is then sampled from this distribution, which is then used by the decoder to reconstruct the input. This makes the latent space continuous, thereby improving its ability to interpolate novel, unseen data. The VAE model can be further improved by enhancing the probability of generating an actual data while keeping the distance between the true and the posterior distribution under a small threshold. This results in the weighting of the KL divergence term in the loss function. The factor determining this weight is represented by β and hence the name β-VAE, which is used in this study. The implementation of the β-VAE is made publicly available in our group’s <a href=\"https://github.com/JMLab-tifrh/Protein_Ligand_Variational_Autoencoder\">Github page</a> (copy archived at <a href=\"#bib54\">JMLab-tifrh, 2024</a>).

Individual, one-dimensional projection of the conformational landscape along each of the two latent dimensions reveals that the presence of the small molecule would shift part of the conformational landscape to a distinct location, suggesting that fasudil would modulate the existing conformational ensemble as well as would create new conformational space.

We verified this by building an MSM for 60 μs of data of fasudil system using 10 μs to 70μs segment of the trajectory (see <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</a>). We find that the MSM built using lesser data (and same amount of data in the αS simulation) also indicated the presence of six states of αS in presence of fasudil, as was observed in the MSM of the full trajectory. We compared the R<sub>g</sub> distribution of this small chunk with the αS ensemble and found to be in good agreement (see <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</a>). Addidtionally, we selected a chunk spanning from 966 μs to 1026 μs and observed a similar distribution of R<sub>g</sub> (see <a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</a>). Moreover, we built a MSM on this new chunk and identified the presence of six states (see <a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</a>). Together, this exercise invalidates the sampling argument and suggests that the increase in the number of metastable macrostates of αS in fasudil solution relative to that in water is a direct outcome of the interaction of αS with the small molecule.",

Even though an increase in the number of latent dimensions may make the model more accurate, this can also result in overfitting. The model can simply memorize the pattern in the data instead of generalizing them. A higher dimensional latent space is also more difficult to interpret; therefore, we chose two dimensions. Nevertheless, we trained another β-VAE with four neurons on the latent space and built a MSM by choosing the appropriate number of microstates (see <a href=\"#fig3s8\">Figure 3—figure supplement 8</a>). The implied timescales (see <a href=\"#fig3s9\">Figure 3—figure supplement 9</a>) indicate the presence of six states which is consistent with the model with two latent dimensions.",

The average inter-residue contact probability maps for each of the metastable states populated in the presence of fasudil and in water are depicted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>, respectively. The residue-wise percentage secondary structure in each of the macrostates are presented in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</a>, respectively. In state FS1, antiparallel β-sheet interactions are formed within the N-terminal region. This β-sheet network also includes long-range interactions of the H2 region of the N-terminus with the negatively charged C-terminal region. Residues 70–80 in the hydrophobic NAC region are also involved in antiparallel β-sheet interactions with residues 120–130 in the C-terminal region. Short parallel β-sheet interactions also exist between the NAC and C-terminal residues with the N-terminal residues. The residues in the C-terminus exhibit 40–90% of β-sheet propensity (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</a>). Long range interactions between N-terminus and C-terminus are relatively diminished in state FS2. This state has multiple parallel β-sheet interactions between short stretches of residues in the NAC region and C-terminal region with the N-terminal region. In addition, antiparallel β-sheet interactions are also present in NAC:N-terminus, NAC:C-terminus and within the N-terminal region. Residues 8–13 in the N-terminus and 86–92 in the NAC region exhibit significant helicity. State FS3 is characterised by ~20% of β-sheet interactions across the entire protein. Hydrophobic and polar, uncharged residues in the range 61–80 in the NAC region are involved in β-sheet interactions with the N-terminus(residues 1–10) and C-terminus(100–120). Moreover, β-sheet interaction networks are also present within the NAC and N-terminal regions. The C-terminal region 100–120 forms long-range interactions with residues 1–10 in the N-terminal region. Extensive short and long-range β-sheet networks are prevalent in state FS4. The entire NAC region forms antiparallel β-sheet network with the N-terminus. The C-terminusforms parallel β-sheets with the NAC and N-terminus. In the most populated state FS5, the key interactions are β-sheets formed between the oppositely charged termini. The NAC region also exhibits <math id=\"inf5\"><mi>α</mi></math>-helical propensity. Finally, in state FS6, the NAC region (residues 60–80) forms antiparallel β-sheet network with the residues 30–60 of the N-terminal segment as well as the C-terminal region 100–120.

The β-sheet network of NAC also incorporates interactions with residues 100–130 in the C-terminal region.

For instance, in state FS2 in which fasudil interacts with multiple sites across the entire length of the protein, the secondary structure properties of this state are dictated by β-sheets formed by short stretches of residues rather than an extensive network. Furthermore, owing to the relatively stronger small-molecule binding interactions with hydrophobic residues in the N-terminus, the long-range interactions of the oppositely charged terminal regions are suppressed. Similarly, in state FS4, since fasudil primarily interacts with residues 120–140 of the C-terminusand other interactions are transient, the conformational properties of this metastable state is marked by a network of β-sheets across the rest of the protein. Essentially, small-molecule binding interactions via stabilisation of various intra-protein interactions modulate the conformational properties of αS.",

Initially, this was attempted using a Convolutional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE) with the contact maps of αS and αS-Fasudil macrostates as inputs. The model was initially trained using the six contact maps of αS-Fasudil system as a test case. However, the model displayed a tendency to overfit by learning an identity function between the input and output, as evident from the large reconstruction error of the test dataset (see <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</a>). This overfitting issue was addressed by training a Denoising CVAE (DCVAE), where the contact map was intentionally corrupted with noise prior to training. This approach successfully mitigated the problem of overfitting as indicated by the loss profile of the test dataset (see <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</a>). An implementation is provided in <a href=\"https://github.com/JMLab-tifrh/Protein_Ligand_Variational_Autoencoder\">GitHub</a> (copy archived at <a href=\"#bib54\">JMLab-tifrh, 2024</a>).",

SSIM measures the similarity between two images as perceived by the human eye by considering the luminance, contrast and structure of the image. SSIM values can range from –1–1, which represents perfect anti-correlation and perfect similarity, respectively (<a href=\"#bib49\">Hore and Ziou, 2010</a>). The SSIM values is tabulated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. We find that the SSIM values for all the metastable states of αS and αS-Fasudil system are close to 1 (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), thereby indicating that the denoised contact map as obtained from the trained DCVAE model is very close to the quality of the original contact map (see <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</a>–<a href=\"#fig6s4\">4</a>). This is also supported by the high Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). PSNR is the ratio of the maximum possible power of a signal to the power of corrupting noise that measures the fidelity of a reconstructed image compared to its original in decibels (dB) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Hore and Ziou, 2010</a>). A higher value of PSNR indicates smaller difference between the original and denoised contact map (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Upon visualizing the latent space, it became evident that the contact map of the metastable states of αS and αS-Fasudil occupy distinct locations within the latent space, which indicates that the DCVAE model effectively captured the distinct patterns among the metastable states.",

In state FS1, fasudil dominantly interacts with residues 133–139 of the C-terminal region, which consists of negatively charged residues D135 and E137 as well as the polar, neutral tyrosine residues (Y133 and Y136). In addition, there are also non-specific interactions of fasudil with hydrophobic residues in the NAC region (residues 71–74). In state FS2, fasudil interactions are spread across the entirety of the protein. These comprise hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal region, neutral polar residues (62–66) in the NAC region and residues 130–136 in the C-terminal region. Fasudil interacts strongly with the NAC region consisting of hydrophobic and polar, neutral residues in state FS3. Interactions also prevail with the negatively charged C-terminal region and residues 1–6 of the N-terminal region. While interacting non-specifically with residues in the amplipathic N-terminal region of state FS4, fasudil preferentially interacts with residues 121–140 of the C-terminal region via charge-charge and <math id=\"inf6\"><mi>π</mi></math>-stacking interactions with the negatively charged residues (D135, E137, E139) and tyrosine side chains (Y125, Y133, Y136).

              "text": "The overall analysis of the conformational ensemble of αS in presence of fasudil demonstrates that small-molecule binding substantially modulates the ensemble of αS. Our results indicate that the interaction of fasudil with αS residues governs the structural features of the protein. Estimation of the metastable states of αS shows that compared to aqueous conditions in which three metastable states are identified, the ensemble populated in the presence of fasudil in solution contains six metastable states. Since IDPs are described as an ensemble unlike folded proteins with a fixed structure, the effect of small molecules binding on disordered proteins or regions, is manifested as modulation of the whole ensemble by shifting the population of the states leading to a change in its conformational entropy (<a href=\"#bib44\">Heller et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Heller et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Flock et al., 2014</a>). The common mechanism that is generally postulated is the <i>entropic collapse</i> or <i>folding upon binding</i> model. (<a href=\"#bib30\">Dyson and Wright, 2002</a>) It describes the disorder-to-order transition that IDPs typically undergo upon interacting with its biological target. This transition leads to the shift in population to a more ordered, predominant state causing a loss of conformational entropy that is compensated by a corresponding enthalpic gain. Conversely, small-molecule binding may also lead to <i>entropic expansion</i> in which newer conformational states are populated that are otherwise undetectable (<a href=\"#bib43\">Heller et al., 2015</a>). Additionally, in cases where there is no gross change in the conformational entropy and the binding is considered <i>fuzzy</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bonomi et al., 2016</a>), referred to as <i>isentropic shift</i>. The observations reported in the present investigation for αS monomer plausibly conform with the entropy-expansion model (<a href=\"#bib44\">Heller et al., 2018</a>). According to this model, the interactions of small molecules with IDPs can promote the exploration of conformations with discernible probability, thereby expanding the disorderedness (conformational entropy) of the ensemble (<a href=\"#bib44\">Heller et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Heller et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Heller et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Löhr et al., 2022</a>). The small molecule interaction with αS operates transiently, and not strongly as seen in structured proteins. These transient local interactions stabilise the conformations that are inaccessible in the absence of the small molecule.",

              "text": "To gain deeper insights into the entropic effect of small-molecule binding to αS, we further estimated protein conformational entropy as well as water (solvent) entropy. We evaluated the entropy of water using the 2PT (<a href=\"#bib65\">Lin et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Lin et al., 2010</a>) method. First, we determined the molar entropy of pure water that yielded an entropy value of 55.5 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K <sup>-1</sup>, which is close to the reported value of 54.4 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K <sup>-1</sup> from free energy perturbation calculation (<a href=\"#bib73\">Mukherjee and Schäfer, 2023</a>). However, the molar entropy is marginally reduced in all the macrostates of both αS and αS-fasudil systems, with values ranging between 55.01 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K <sup>-1</sup> to 55.25 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K <sup>-1</sup>, with difference from that of bulk water being negligible. Upon closer investigation of the translational and rotational components of the total water entropy, we find that that the decrease of the translational component is more pronounced as compared to the rotational component. This implies that αS in its apo state or in the presence of fasudil has a comparatively greater impact on the translational component than on the rotational component of the entropy of water (see <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</a>). Nonetheless, the entropy analysis suggests that the presence of fasudil has an insignificant impact on the entropy of water.",

              "text": "Next, we estimated the protein conformational entropy using the PDB2ENTROPY program (<a href=\"#bib39\">Fogolari et al., 2018</a>) that implements the Maximum Information Spanning Tree (MIST) approach (<a href=\"#bib55\">King and Tidor, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">King et al., 2012</a>) on sets of torsional angles of the protein. The entropy is calculated from probability distributions of torsional degrees of freedom of the protein relative to random distribution i.e. corresponding to a fully flexible protein chain. The total protein entropy values for the metastable states in water (MS1 to MS3) and fasudil-bound states (FS1 to FS6) are shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. While the conformational entropies of the ligand-free states, MS1 to MS3, range from –72 to –75 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, the entropy of fasudil-bound states (FS1 to FS6) vary from –70 to –86 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, indicating that binding of fasudil to αS leads to a broadening of the span of entropy of these states. The highest entropy among the metastable states in the two environments correspond to FS5 and MS2 with values of –70.8 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> and –72.3 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. These states are also the most populated metastable states. MS1 and MS3 states have entropy values of –73.9 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> and –74.5 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Notably, the presence of fasudil and its interactions with the protein chains can elicit the exploration of states that are more ordered in nature or increasingly deviated from a random chain. The largest deviation from a fully disordered chain is attained by the state FS1 with entropy value of –85.3 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, followed by FS2 having entropy of –83.1 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>. FS4 is also relatively more ordered than FS5 with entropy of –76.2 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>. FS3 and FS6 are closely disordered as FS5 with entropy values of –73.2 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup> and –72.5 J mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. These observations of the total extent of disorderedness of the metastable states clearly indicate that the interactions of fasudil with αS residues can restrict their conformational degrees of freedom thus entrapping the protein in specific conformational states, thus manifesting as overall decrease in the protein entropy. Considering the diffuse binding of fasudil across several residues along the entire length of the protein, we further estimated and analysed how the entropic contributions are affected at the residue level (shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8—figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s3\">3</a>). The total residue-wise entropy presented in <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</a> shows that the residues in the N-terminal region of fasudil-bound states FS1 and FS2, exhibit greater entropic fluctuations i.e. more negative values from the apo metastable states (MS1 to MS3), suggesting more ordered or restricted fluctuations of these residues. We note that the propensity of fasudil binding to the N-terminal residues is higher in FS1 and FS2, relative to other states (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We further decoupled the residue entropy into backbone and sidechain components; this analysis is depicted in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</a>, respectively. Comparison of the sidechain entropies, computed from the <math id=\"inf7\"><mi>χ</mi></math> torsion angles, for the unbound and bound states, does not show significant alteration upon small-molecule binding. Conversely, increased fluctuations in residue backbone entropies are observed in response to small-molecule binding (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). The metastable states, MS1 to MS3, populated in water have minimally fluctuating residue entropies amongst the states. In contrast, significant fluctuations in residue entropies are noted predominantly in the N-terminal region (residues 1–60) and to some extent in the NAC region for states FS1 and FS2. These residues in the N-terminal region in FS1 and FS2 experience a drop in backbone entropy owing to the restricted degrees of freedom from fasudil binding. The decrease in residue backbone entropy correlates with fasudil binding hotspots and therefore can be ascribed to small-molecule interactions. Hydrophobic residues in the NAC region show decrease in entropy in ligand-binding locations mainly in state FS1, FS2, and FS4. However, intriguingly, we note that the correlation between fasudil interactions and residue entropy is not observed in state FS3. Finally, in the negatively charged C-terminal region, where fasudil preferentially targets the entire region in the αS protein, residue-wise entropic fluctuations are minimal compared to the apo state. Robustelli et al. refer to the interaction of fasudil with the C-terminal region as dynamic shuttling, in which breaking and formation of interactions with nearby residues occur simultaneously. This dynamic shuttling mechanism could possibly minimise the backbone entropic fluctuations compared to the relatively specific binding in the N-terminusand NAC regions.",

Although a state with higher population might not always have the higher entropy, we observed that in our case, the state with the highest population also has the highest protein entropy, for both αS and αS-Fasudil system. States with higher entropy are thermodynamically favored which in turn can affect the rates of state transitions, potentially influencing MFPT values. To decipher this, we have compared the transition times of each metastable state to the most populated state with the entropy of the state, and found a strong degree of correlation (see <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9e</a>). This suggests that a state with higher entropy, which also has more number of accessible microstates, potentially provide multiple pathways for other macrostates to access this state for both αS and αS-Fasudil system. However, as compared to αS in its apo state, the apparent increase (∼2–20 times) in the time to transition to the major state in αS-Fasudil system, suggests that fasudil may potentially trap the protein conformations in the intermediate states, thereby slowing down αS in exploring the large conformational space in presence of fasudil.",

              "text": "The conformationally dynamic disordered proteins challenge the application of conventional structure-based drug-design methods that relies on the specificity of a binding pocket, based on which the drug molecule is designed and optimized. A general framework describes the effect of small-molecule binding to IDPs by modulation of the disordered ensemble by increasing or decreasing its conformational entropy. Here, we characterised the effect of the small molecule, fasudil, on the conformational characteristics of the quintessential IDP, α-synuclein. Fasudil has been experimentally reported to curb the aggregation of αS both in vivo and in vitro. The ensemble view of long time scale atomic simulations of fasudil binding to αS monomer displays a fuzzy ensemble of αS with preferential binding of fasudil to the C-terminal region via charge-charge interactions and aromatic stacking. Using a deep neural-network based machine learning approach, variational autoencoder, we reconstructed a high dimensional feature that is Cα-pairwise distance into a two-dimensional latent space. We built an MSM using this data to delineate the metastable conformational states of αS and identify the differences that arise from small-molecule interactions. Comparison of the metastable states of αS in the presence and absence of the small molecule fasudil revealed that the small-molecule binding navigates the structural landscape of the protein. Importantly, more number of metastable states are populated indicating that small-molecule mediated conformational modulation led to entropy expansion (see <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9d–e</a>). Atomic-level MD simulations have slowly emerged as a valuable tool for complementing experimental measurements of disordered proteins and providing detailed descriptions of their conformational ensembles (<a href=\"#bib29\">Dedmon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Allison et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Ullman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Esteban-Martín et al., 2013</a>). With improvements in force fields (<a href=\"#bib13\">Best et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Huang et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Robustelli et al., 2018</a>) that model disordered proteins, the accuracy of MD simulations has dramatically increased, as assessed by their agreement with a wide variety of experimental measurements. Integrative approaches use a combination of experimental restraints such as chemical shifts, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE; <a href=\"#bib29\">Dedmon et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bertoncini et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Allison et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Esteban-Martín et al., 2013</a>), residual dipolar coupling constants (RDCs; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bertoncini et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bernadó et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Marsh et al., 2008</a>), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bernadó et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ahmed et al., 2021</a>) and computational models from MD simulations to generate a more accurate description of the ensemble of disordered proteins. More recent advances include statistical approaches such as Bayesian inference models like Metainference (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bonomi et al., 2016</a>), Experimental Inferential Structure Determination (EISD; <a href=\"#bib20\">Brookes and Head-Gordon, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Lincoff et al., 2020</a>) and Maximum Entropy formulations (<a href=\"#bib84\">Roux and Weare, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Boomsma et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Cavalli et al., 2013</a>) that also take into account the experimental and back-calculation model errors and uncertainties. Such improved approaches to leverage MD simulations with improved force fields and experimental knowledge-based ensemble generation have shown tremendous potential for describing molecular recognition mechanisms of IDPs with other protein partners; scenarios such as folding-upon-binding (<a href=\"#bib30\">Dyson and Wright, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Robustelli et al., 2020</a>) or self-dimerisation. More importantly, a set of recent initiatives have focussed on molecular characterisation of the interaction of small-molecules with IDPs via effective combination of atomistic simulation and biophysical experiments (<a href=\"#bib45\">Heller et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Robustelli et al., 2022</a>).",

The implementation of Markov state model in the present work clearly brings out the feasibility of metastable states that would have a finite ‘stationary’ or equilibrium population in presence of small-molecule or in neat water. The uniqueness of these states is supported from the projection of their inter-residue Cα contact map of the macrostates using DCVAE model. Our systematic investigation of the impact of fasudil on αS monomer ensemble reveals the altering effects of small-molecule interaction on αS ensemble by tuning the entropy of these states. Insights from studies targeting structural ensemble modulation by small-molecule can be effectively harnessed in designing drug-design strategies for aggregation diseases.",

Shaw Research with the Anton supercomputerthat is specially purposed for running long-time-scale simulations (<a href=\"#bib83\">Robustelli et al., 2022</a>). The protein was solvated in a cubic water-box with 108 sides and containing 50 mM concentration of Na or Cl ions. Protein, water molecules and ions present in the system were parameterised with the a99SB-<i>disp</i> force field (<a href=\"#bib81\">Robustelli et al., 2018</a>). The small-molecule, fasudil, was parameterised using the generalised Amber force-field (GAFF). Production run of the system was performed in the NPT ensemble. Further details of the MD simulation can be obtained by referring to the original work by <a href=\"#bib83\">Robustelli et al., 2022</a>. The extensive simulation trajectories were generously made available by D. E. Shaw Research upon request. To generate αS ensemble in water, we performed multiple simulations of αS monomer. An IDP is not represented by a fixed structure. Therefore, it would be most appropriate to run multiple simulations starting from different initial structures and simulate the local environment around those structures; thus generating an ensemble effectively sampling the phase space. Accordingly, for initiating the apo simulations, instead of biasing the initial structure (using the starting structure used for simulations with fasudil), we randomly chose 23 different conformations from previously reported (<a href=\"#bib81\">Robustelli et al., 2018</a>) multi-µs αS trajectory in water. We have also determined the R<sub>g</sub> values corresponding to the starting structures used to start the apo simulations. It is evident that the 23 starting conformations chosen represent the entire span of the R<sub>g</sub> space that is sampled in the fasudil ensemble (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, we have also calculated the RMSD of the starting structures with respect to the starting structure of the fasudil simulation (see <a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</a>), secondary structure content (see <a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1—figure supplements 8</a>–<a href=\"#fig1s10\">10</a>) and solvent accessible surface area (SASA; see <a href=\"#fig1s11\">Figure 1—figure supplements 11</a>–<a href=\"#fig1s12\">12</a>) to validate our choice of starting structures.The simulation details are described below. Each protein conformation is solvated in a cubic box (see <a href=\"#table1\">Table 1</a>) of explicit water molecules and Na or Cl ions were added to a concentration of 50 mM, to maintain the same conditions as used in the simulations with fasudil. The all-atom a99SB-<i>disp</i> force field and water model (<a href=\"#bib81\">Robustelli et al., 2018</a>) were used to simulate the protein and solvent. The unbiased MD simulations were performed using the Gromacs simulation package (<a href=\"#bib68\">Lindahl et al., 2020</a>). A timestep of 2 fs and the leap-frog integrator was used. The simulation was performed in the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble at an average temperature of 300 K, maintained using the v-rescale thermostat (<a href=\"#bib21\">Bussi et al., 2007</a>) with a relaxation time of 0.1 ps and a pressure of 1 bar using the Parrinello-Rahman barostat (<a href=\"#bib78\">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</a>) with a time constant of 2 ps for coupling. The Verlet cutoff scheme (<a href=\"#bib77\">Páll and Hess, 2013</a>) with 1.0 nm cutoff was applied for Lennard-Jones interactions and short-range electrostatic interactions. Long-range electrostatic interactions were computed using the Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) summation method (<a href=\"#bib105\">York et al., 1993</a>) and covalent bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the LINCS algorithm (<a href=\"#bib46\">Hess et al., 1997</a>). All the systems were minimized using the steepest descent algorithm, followed by equilibration in the isothermal-isochoric (NVT) and subsequently in the NPT ensemble with position restraints on the heavy atoms of the protein. Twenty-three simulations, each starting from different conformations, were performed. These simulation timescales are variable, ranging from 1 to 4 µs, amounting to a cumulative length of ~62 µs.",

We employed PyEMMA (<a href=\"#bib86\">Scherer et al., 2015</a>), an MSM building and analysis package. The 2D data is subjected to <i>k</i>-means clustering. We used the VAMP-2 score to determine the number of microstates. By varying the number of microstates from 10 to 220, we found that the VAMP-2 score saturated at higher numbers for both αS and αS-Fasudil simulations. We find that the VAMP-2 score has saturated at 180 microstates (see <a href=\"#fig3s10\">Figure 3—figure supplements 10</a>–<a href=\"#fig3s11\">11</a>). A transition matrix was then built by counting the number of transitions among the microstates at a specific lag time. To choose the lag time, the implied timescale (ITS) or relaxation timescales of the systems were calculated over a range of lag times and plotted as a function of lag time. The timescale at which the ITS plot levels off is chosen as the lag time to build the final MSM. The ITS plots corresponding to the neat water and aqueous fasudil systems are presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>. Accordingly, MSM lag times of 36 and 32 ns were selected for neat water fasudil systems, respectively. At these lag times, by identifying the gaps between the ITS, a three-state model for neat water and a six-state model for aqueous fasudil system was built. Lastly, the transition path theory (<a href=\"#bib102\">Weinan and Vanden-Eijnden, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Metzner et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Noé et al., 2009</a>) was used to ascertain the transition paths, fluxes and timescales in these models. Bootstrapping was performed to estimate the errors associated with the state populations and transition timescales. In ten iterations, the model was rebuilt after eliminating a randomly selected trajectory followed by calculation of the state populations and transition timescales. The mean value and standard deviations of the values collected by bootstrapping are reported. A Chapman-Kolmogorov test was performed for the MSMs of the neat water and small molecule ensembles, that tests the validity of the model prediction at longer time scales (see <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</a>).",

A single snapshot was chosen from each macrostate of α-synuclein in its apo state and in presence of fasudil, which were then solvated in a cubic box, placed within 1 nm from the box edge. The system was neutralized using NaCl and the salt concentration was kept at 50 mM. The system was energy minimized using the steepest descent algorithm, followed by equilibration in the canonical ensemble for 2 ps. The average temperature was maintained at 300 K using velocity rescale thermostat with a time constant of 0.1 ps. Following this, NPT equilibration was performed for 2 ps to maintain the pressure at 1.0 bar using the Berendsen barostat. Finally, three independent production runs were performed from the equilibrated structures in the NPT ensemble using the velocity-verlet integrator with a timestep of 1 fs for a timescale of 20 ps with frames saved at every 4 fs. In addition, we have performed three simulations of neat water using the parameters as described for the macrostates.",

This recommendation also directly conflicts with Referee 2's request for greater diversity in starting structures. Our manuscript provided robust evidence that our initial configurations are indeed diverse, with one configuration coincidentally matching that used in the ligand-bound simulations.

Additionally single and double mutant synT-Y133A and synT-Y136A (tyrosine is replaced with alanine), when treated with fasudil, had no significant effect as evident from immunochemistry, thereby indicating that α-synuclein aggregation can be inhibited by the interaction of C-terminal tyrosines with fasudil.

Unlike conventional linear dimension reduction methods such as tICA (as provided in the SI), this method has been found to be better (higher VAMP2 score) in capturing slow modes and thereby facilitate the study of long-time dynamics. Markov State Model was built on this lower dimension space which indicated the presence of three and six states for the apo and holo simulations respectively. The exclusivity of the states was justified by determining the backbone contact map and further mapping these states using a denoising CNN-VAE. The increase in the number of states in the presence of the small molecule was justified by calculating the entropy of the macrostates. The entropic contribution from water remained similar across all states, while for the protein in the holo ensemble, entropy was significantly modulated (either increased or decreased) compared to the apo state. In contrast, the entropy of the apo states showed much less modulation. This proves that an increase in the number of states is primarily an entropic effect caused by the small molecule. Finally we have compared the mean first passage time (MFPT) of other states to the most populated state, which reveals a strong correlation between transition time and the system's entropy for both apo and holo ensemble. However, the transition times (to the most populated state) are much lower for the holo ensemble, thereby suggesting that fasudil may potentially trap the protein conformations in the intermediate states, thereby slowing down αS in exploring the large conformational space and eventually slow down aggregation.",

For someone to get the gist of the work, the last paragraph of the introduction and first paragraph of conclusion provides a summary of the overall finding and investigation in the manuscript. First, a VAE-based machine learning approach demonstrates the modulation of free energy landscape of alpha-synuclein in presence of fasudil. Next, Markov State Model elucidates distinct binding competing states of alpha-synuclein in presence of the small-molecule drug. Then the MSMderived metastable states of alpha-synuclein monomer are structurally characterized in presence of fasudil. Next we mapped the macrostates in apo and bound-state ensembles using denoising convolutional variational autoencoder, to ensure that these are mutually distinct. Next we show that fasudil exhibits conformation-dependent interactions with individual metastable states. Finally the investigation quantatively brings out entropic signatures of small molecule binding.",

Similarly, other structural properties such as SASA, Ree and secondary structure are comparable for the two ensembles. These analyses show that the local sampling across a variety of starting conformations has ensured sufficient sampling of the IDP phase space.

However, owing to the few number of contact maps, the model overfitted and to prevent this, we added noise to the data. A visual inspection of the ensemble averaged contact map, especially for IDPs is difficult and this lower dimensional space will give us a preliminary idea of how each macrostate is different from every other. The table in Fig. 6C provides scores for the denoised contact maps (SSIM and PSNR scores).

A visual inspection of the ensemble averaged contact map, especially for IDPs is much more difficult as compared to folded proteins.

In this study - they utilized the variational approach to Markov processes (VAMP) to build an MSM using a 1D order parameter as input (the radius of gyration), first discretizing the conformational space into 300 microstates before similarly building a 6 macrostate model. From examining the contact maps and secondary structure propensities of the holo MSMs from the current study and the previous study- some of the macrostates appear similar, however there appear to be orders of magnitude differences in the timescales of conformational transitions between the two models. The timescales of conformational transitions in the previous MSM are on the order of 10s of microseconds, while the timescales of transitions in this manuscript are 100s-1000s microseconds. In the previous manuscript, a 3 state MSM is built from an apo α-synuclein obtained from a continuous 73ms unbiased MD simulation of alpha-synuclein run at a different salt concentration (100mM) and an additional 33 ms of shorter simulations. The apo MSM from the previous study similarly reports very fast timescales of transitions between apo states (on the order ~1ms) - while the MSM reported in the current study (Figure 9) are on the order of 10s-100s of microseconds.",

In this manuscript, we have used a much more general collective variable, reduced pairwise distance using VAE. Firstly, the collective variables used to build the model in the two works are different. Secondly, for the 73 μs apo simulation in the previous manuscript, the salt concentration used was 100 mM, but in this work, we have used a salt concentration of 50 mM, same as the salt concentration used in the holo simulations. Since the two simulation conditions are different with respect to salt concentration, the conformational space sampled in these conditions will be different and this will be reflected in the nature/features of the metastable states and the associated transition kinetics. Thirdly, the lag time at which the MSM was built was 3.6 ns in the previous manuscript, whereas, in this work we have used 32 ns. This is already off by a factor of 10. So the order of timescales have also changed. Thus, changes in the collective variable and change in the lag time at which the system reaches Markovianity is different. Hence, the timescales of transition among the macrostates are also different. Because of these differences, it would not be correct to compare the results that we would get from the two investigations.",

In order to provide insight into the binding mechanism of Fasudil the authors analyze an unbiased 1500us MD simulation of alpha-synuclein in the presence of Fasudil previously reported by Robustelli et.al. (Journal of the American Chemical Society, 144(6), pp.2501-2510). The authors compare this simulation to a very different set of apo simulations: 23 separate1-4us simulations of alpha-synuclein seeded from different apo conformations taken from another previously reported by Robustelli et. al.

The authors utilize k-means clustering to cluster the sampled states of alpha-synuclein in each condition into 180 microstates on the VAE latent space. They then coarse grain these 180 microstates into a 3-macrostate model for apo alpha-synuclein and a 6-macrostate model for alpha-synuclein in the presence of fasudil using the PCCA+ course graining method. Few details are provided to explain the hyperparameters used for PCCA+ coarse graining and the rationale for selecting the final number of macrostates.",
