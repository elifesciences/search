          "text": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is activated by dimerization, but activation also generates higher-order multimers, whose nature and function are poorly understood. We have characterized ligand-induced dimerization and multimerization of EGFR using single-molecule analysis, and show that multimerization can be blocked by mutations in a specific region of Domain IV of the extracellular module. These mutations reduce autophosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of EGFR and attenuate phosphorylation of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase, which is recruited by EGFR. The catalytic activity of EGFR is switched on through allosteric activation of one kinase domain by another, and we show that if this is restricted to dimers, then sites in the tail that are proximal to the kinase domain are phosphorylated in only one subunit. We propose a structural model for EGFR multimerization through self-association of ligand-bound dimers, in which the majority of kinase domains are activated cooperatively, thereby boosting tail phosphorylation."

This species is characterized by body mass and stature similar to small-bodied human populations but a small endocranial volume similar to australopiths. Cranial morphology of <i>H. naledi</i> is unique, but most similar to early <i>Homo</i> species including <i>Homo erectus</i>, <i>Homo habilis</i> or <i>Homo rudolfensis</i>. While primitive, the dentition is generally small and simple in occlusal morphology. <i>H. naledi</i> has humanlike manipulatory adaptations of the hand and wrist. It also exhibits a humanlike foot and lower limb. These humanlike aspects are contrasted in the postcrania with a more primitive or australopith-like trunk, shoulder, pelvis and proximal femur. Representing at least 15 individuals with most skeletal elements repeated multiple times, this is the largest assemblage of a single species of hominins yet discovered in Africa."

The collection is a morphologically homogeneous sample that can be attributed to no previously-known hominin species. Here we describe this new species, <i>Homo naledi</i>.

During a relatively short excavation, our team recovered an extensive collection of 1550 hominin specimens, representing nearly every element of the skeleton multiple times (Figure 1), including many complete elements and morphologically informative fragments, some in articulation, as well as smaller fragments many of which could be refit into more complete elements. The collection is a morphologically homogeneous sample that can be attributed to no previously-known hominin species. Here we describe this new species, <i>Homo naledi</i>. We have not defined <i>H. naledi</i> narrowly based on a single jaw or skull because the entire body of material has informed our understanding of its biology."

When I was at high school my interest in TVs, cars and trucks made me think of becoming an engineer, but what later impressed me were the cells that build an organism, and how they build and maintain themselves. During my undergraduate and Masters studies I was interested in studying how proteins are transported within cells. This interest evolved into my current research on proteostasis – the biological pathways that control protein folding, trafficking and degradation within cells."

Some of these proteins can still work if they reach their proper destination, but proteostasis degrades them before they get there. If we understand how proteostasis removes the mutant proteins, we could try to alter proteostasis to allow these proteins to reach their proper destination. Then, we may be able to cure genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis and Wilson’s disease (a condition where copper accumulates in the body)."

Like in any other manufacturing factory, cells have quality control processes, and in cells these quality control processes remove faulty proteins. I study how CFTR quality control is regulated in order to devise a new tool to ‘cheat’ this control. This would allow the CFTR channels to be more efficiently trafficked to their proper places in the cell, and so reduce the symptoms of cystic fibrosis."
